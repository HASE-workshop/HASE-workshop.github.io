# HASE (High Assurance Systems Engineering) is an invite-only workshop.

Our goal for HASE is to bring together the best implementers and verification experts from open source, industry, and academia, introduce them and their projects to each other, and develop collaborations to produce verified, trustworthy systems code (we do not, however, want to nail down exactly what is meant by “systems code”).


Its first meeting will be on Saturday 12 and Sunday 13 January 2019 with an optional Hack Day on Monday 14 January 2019. The venue is the [X](https://x.company/) (previously called Google[x]) campus
in Mountain View, California, USA.
On the Saturday and Sunday we will start at 10AM and end at 6PM. On the Monday Hack Day we will begin at 9AM and end at 3PM.

It is co-located with the [Real World Crypto](https://rwc.iacr.org/) conference, taking the place of [HACS](HACS-workshop.github.io), which is not being run in 2019.

Please contact Sarah de Haas at dehaass@google.com if you have any questions about the event.

## Venue
The workshop will be held in the RLS2 building at the [X](https://x.company/) campus located at [250 Mayfield Avenue, California 94043](https://goo.gl/maps/tVLjsRE1j4n).

This is a single story building on the right hand
side of Mayfield Avenue as you enter (and it is not the large multistorey building to your left which is RLS1). The venue is right next to [San Antonio CalTrain station](http://www.caltrain.com/stations/sanantoniostation.html)
which has trains from/to San Francisco and San Jose. There is plenty of parking next to the RLS2 building. The enterance is locked during the weekend so Satnam or another
Googler will be at the enterance between 9:30am and 10am to let you in.
If you need help please call the local contact Satnam Singh on +1 408 656 4590 (also a WhatsApp number) or email satnam@google.com or via iMessage with satnam@raintown.org or
via Facebook Messenger. You'll need to do this if you arrive after 10am.

Please plan to arrive at 9:30am for coffee on Saturday, Sunday and optionally Monday so we can start promptly at 10am. On Monday the lobby will be open but you will still need
to be issued a visitor badge.
