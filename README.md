HASE (High Assurance Systems Engineering) is an invite-only workshop.

Our goal for HASE is to bring together the best implementers and verification experts from open source, industry, and academia, introduce them and their projects to each other, and develop collaborations to produce verified, trustworthy systems code (we do not, however, want to nail down exactly what is meant by “systems code”).


Its first meeting will be on Saturday 12 and Sunday 13 January 2019 with an optional Hack Day on Monday 14 January 2014. The venue is the X (previously called Google[x]) in Mountain View, California, USA.

It is co-located with the [Real World Crypto](https://rwc.iacr.org/) conference, taking the place of [HACS](HACS-workshop.github.io), which is not being run in 2019.

Website under construction.
